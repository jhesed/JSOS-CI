# JSOS-CI
Website created for <i>JSOS Christian Church.</i><br/>
This was written in <i><b>PHP (CodeIgniter), MySQL, Javascript (Jquery), CSS and HTML</b></i>.<br/>

This was previously written in <b>Python Tornado</b> before, but there was no free web server for <i>Python</i> during that time.
This was also replaced with <b><i>JSOS-WP</i></b>, a <i>WordPress</i> version (<i>www.jsoscc.com</i>).
This is because I only have limited spare time to update the website.  Hence, a <i>CMS</i> version was perfect.
