# JSOS-CI
Website created for <i>JSOS Christian Church.</i><br/>
This was written in <i><b>PHP (CodeIgniter), MySQL, Javascript (Jquery), CSS and HTML</b></i>.<br/>

This was previously written in <b>Python Tornado</b>, but there was no free web server for <i>Python</i> during that time.<br/><br/>

But since I only have limited spare time to update the <i>Python / PHP</i> websites, I later on replaced both with <b><i>JSOS-WP</i></b>, a <i>WordPress</i> version(<i>www.jsoscc.com</i>), as <i>CMS</i> was perfect for non-developers.<br/>
