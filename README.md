# JSOS-CI
Website created for <i>JSOS Christian Church.</i><br/>
This was written in <i>PHP (CodeIgniter), Javascript (Jquery), CSS and HTML</i>.<br/>

However, this was later on replaced with <b><i>JSOS-WP</i></b>, a <i>WordPress</i> version.
This is because I only have limited spare time to update the website.  Hence, a <i>CMS</i> version would be perfect.
