			<p class="bottom-20">
				The name JSOS was not decided upon by the small group of Christian incorporators through haphazard thinking and careless discussion. Instead, the name came about as a result of deep individual and group prayers and meditation not only on the Bible but also on certain events preceeding the establishment of the church that bears the said name.
				After much prayerful discussion that lasted months, the incorporators of the said group were one in testifying that the name, " JESUS: Sovereign Overcoming Shepherd " is God-given for the specific purposes He has stored for this church.

				JESUS truly is the SOVEREIGN OVERCOMING SHEPHERD!

				<h3>JESUS IS SOVEREIGN</h3>

				<p class="left_0p">His sovereignity refers to His outstanding characteristics and abilities. It signifies His being the best in every good feeling, thoughts, intention and action. </p>

				<p class="left_0p">That God is sovereign does not take away the fact that He still has many enemies. In fact, we, Christians have many enemies ourselves beginning with the chief opponent himself, Satan. In the Bible, Satan has mobilized his demonic forces to oppose God's people in every possible way. With God's loving and sovereign permission, the devil uses problems, sicknesses, failures, other people and even nature and circumstances to overcome us. But praise God because Jesus overrules all of them! In fact, Satan has thrown everything to Jesus in his attempt to defeat our Great Shepherd. But JESUS walloped him repeatedly from the temptation in the wilderness ( Matthew 4:1-11 ) to his resurection from the dead. (John 10:17,18; 20:1-31;Colossians 2;9-15) Jesus overruled demons, sicknesses, nature, evil plots and people in the course of His earthly life. He will continue to do so until the total annihilation of all His enemies. </p>

				<h3>JESUS IS THE SHEPHERD</h3>
				<img class="img_shadow center left-50p bottom-20" src="<?php echo $this->config->item('static_url').'img/aboutus/tbn_shepherd.jpg'; ?>">
				<p class="left_0p">This is an already widely accepted fact through out the universal body of Christian believers. Ever since King David wrote and sung, " The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want " ( Psalm 23:1 ), God's people have learned to look up to the Lord as the shepherd who leads them in life. When JESUS became a man, He declared, " I am the good Shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep . . . I know my sheep pand my sheep know me-just as the Father knows me and I know the Father-I lay down my life for the sheep. " ( John 10:11-15 ) As our shepherd, Jesus loves us and provides for our needs consistently. </p>
