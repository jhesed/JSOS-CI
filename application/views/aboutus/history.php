			<p class="left-50p bottom-20">The JSOS Christian Church had its obscure beginning way back in 1992.</p>

			<p class="left-50p bottom-20">That was after Pastor Jose C. Tacadena and his family (composed of wife Adelia, and children Jihrael and
			Jehannah ) left Manila where they had lived and ministered for six years. Having arrived in Angono, Rizal
			where his parents live, the couple was encouraged to hold regular Bible studies there.</p>

			<p class="left-50p bottom-20">The initial attendees were composed of that extended family ( parents Domingo and Maria, sisters Lydia, Perla,
			Rose and Tess, and older brother Romeo and his wife sis. Aida ), and a few faithful friends and co-workers in
			Christ from their previous Manila ministry. ( sisters Adah and Allaine Nicolas, Baby and Berna Aquino, and
			Jimmy Manarang ).</p>

			<p class="left-50p bottom-20">Later on, the turn of events confirmed God's leading to establish a local church right in Rainbow Village.
			The house of Domingo Tacadena served as its house church then.</p>

			<p class="left-50p bottom-20">The name JESUS; SUPREME OVERRULING SHEPHERD CHRISTIAN church was chosen after much prayer and deliberation among the original incorporators primarily as a testimony
			of God's overruling supremacy in character and deeds, His overruling ability over all creations and principalities, and his unending personal love for every one, particularly for His sheep.</p>

			<p class="left-50p">After five months of holding mere home Bible studies at the said house, the small group of believers finally had their first Sunday Morning Worship Service on June 28, 1992.
			Since Tacadena's house was obviously not ideal for corporate worship, the JSOS initial members and leaders prayed for a larger area.
			With God's mercy and provision, Delfin Tacadena, the pastor's eldest brother, bought a lot with unfinished house in front of the orlginal sight. Brother Delfin developed it and lent it to
			the church to become it's official church worship center.</p>
