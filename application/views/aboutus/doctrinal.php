" –1 Corinthians 1:10 ) .  The wordings here are not inspired or contented for but the truth set forth is held to be essential to a full gospel Christian ministry. 			</p>			<p class="bottom-10">					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No claim is made that it contains all biblical truths for the obvious reason that this is merely a partial list.  Hence, the list may be added upon with supplementary and additional statements in the future.			</p>			<p class="bottom-30">				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we strongly believe that this list is Bible-based and is helpful for the identify and growth of the JSOS Christian Church.			</p>			<h3 class="left-20p">I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE BIBLE </h3>			<p class="bottom-10 top-10 left-60p">				We believe in the scripture, both the Old and the New Testament comprising of books to be verbally inspired by God for men.  These are inerrant ( faultless ) in writings and are  thus the sole supreme authority in the rule of Christian faith and conduct  ( 2 Timothy 3:16;  1 Thessalonians 2:13.  2 Pete 1:21 )			</p>						<h3 class="left-20p">II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	GOD </h3>			<p class="bottom-10 top-10 left-60p">				We believe in the one true God who has revealed Himself as the eternally Self- existent One, the Creator of heaven and earth, and the Redeemer of mankind.  We further believe that this God reveals Himself to us in three distinctive existing persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (  Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14; John 14:16,17 )			</p>						<h3 class="left-20p">III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	JESUS CHRIST </h3>			<p class="bottom-10 top-10 left-60p">				We believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as the eternal SON of GOD.  As such, we believe in His:			</p>				<p class="bottom-10 left-60p">					A.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Virgin Birth and Humanity  ( Matthew 1:23 ; Luke 1:31-35 )				</p>				<p class="bottom-10 left-60p">					B.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deity  (Hebrews 1:8 ; John 10:30 ;  20:28… )				</p>				<p class="bottom-10 left-60p">					C.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinless life (  Hebrews 7:26 ; 1 Peter 2:22  )				</p>				<p class="bottom-10 left-60p">					D.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substitutionary and atoning death on the cross according to the Scripture ( 1 Corinthians 15:3 ; 2 Corinthians 5:21 )				</p>				<p class="bottom-10 left-60p">					E.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodily Resurrection from the dead ( Matthew 28:16 ; Luke 24:39 ; 1 Corinthians 15:4 )				</p>				<p class="bottom-10 left-60p">					F.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ascension into heaven and exaltation to the right hand of God ( Acts 1:9 ;11 ; 22 Philippians 2:9-11 )  				</p>								<h3 class="left-20p">IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	HOLY SPIRIT </h3>			<p class="bottom-10 top-10 left-60p">				We believe that the Holy Spirit is a divine person possessing all the attributes of deity. We further believe  the following regarding Him:			</p>				<p class="bottom-10 left-60p">					A.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the unbelievers				</p>					<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">						•	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He convicts them of sin, righteousness and judgment ( John 16:5-11 )					</p>									<p class="bottom-10 left-60p">									B.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the believers				</p>					<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">						1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	He baptizes them into the Body of Christ  ( 1 Corinthians 12:13 )					</p>					<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">						2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	He causes their regeneration ( John 3:3-6 )					</p>									<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">						3.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He indwells them  ( 1 Corinthians 6:14-16 )					</p>					<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">						4.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He fills them with Himself  ( Ephesians 5:18 )					</p>					<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">						5.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  He gives them spiritual gifts listed in the Bible for service in the church. ( 1 Corinthians 12:27-31 )					</p>			<h3 class="left-20p">V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	MAN </h3>			<p class="bottom-10 top-10 left-60p">				We believe that man was created in the image of God. However, he sinned and thereby incurred not only physical death but also spiritual death which is separation to God. ( Genesis 1:26,27; 2:17; 3:6; Romans 5:12-19 )						<p class="bottom-10 left-60p">				We also believe that man is a tripartite being, body, soul and spirit ( 1 Thessalonians 5:23 )			</p>						<h3 class="left-20p">VI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	SALVATION </h3>			<p class="bottom-10 top-10 left-60p">				We believe that salvation is only possible because of  God’s grace and initiative, which is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ on the cross for us .			</p>				<p class="bottom-10 left-60p">					A.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Condition				</p>					<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">						Salvation is received through repentance and faith towards the Lord Jesus Christ ( Luke 24:47; Romans 10:13-15; Ephesians 2:8,9 )					</p>				<p class="bottom-10 left-60p">					B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Evidence of Salvation				</p>					<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">						The inward witness  of salvation is the direct witness of the Holy Spirit                   ( Romans 8:16 ) in the light and context of Biblical promises on it. ( 1 John 5:  ) The outward evidence to all men is a life of righteousness and true holiness. ( Ephesians 4:24; Titus 2:12 )					</p>			<h3 class="left-20p">VII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	SANCTIFICATION </h3>			<p class="bottom-10 top-10 left-60p">				We believe that God desires sanctification  for each of His child. Sanctification is  an act of separation from that which is evil and of dedication unto God.                           ( Romans 12:1,2; 1 Thessalonians 5:3; Hebrews 13:13 ) This can be done by the power of the Lord Jesus Christ.			</p>						<h3 class="left-20p">VIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	JUSTIFICATION </h3>			<p class="bottom-10 top-10 left-60p">				We believe that God’s children are justified. Justification is to acquit, declare righteous and pronounce sentence of acceptance into which one enters by faith. Justification is primarily a change of position on the part of the sinner. Once condemned, he is now acquitted; once under divine judgment, he is now the subject of divine commendation			</p>			<p class="bottom-10 left-60p">				The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ represent the outward provision for man’s salvation. The term justification has reference to the way in which the saying benefits of Christ’s death are made available for the individual. Faith is the means whereby the sinner lays hold of the benefit.			</p>			<h3 class="left-20p">IX.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp	CHURCH </h3>			<p class="bottom-10 top-10 left-60p">				We believe that the church is the body of Christ, the habitation of God through the Holy Spirit with divine appointment for the fulfillment of her great commission. Every genuine Christian believer is an integral part of it. (  Ephesians 1L22,23; Hebrews 12;23 )			</p>			<p class="bottom-10 left-60p">				A.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ORDINANCES OF THE CHURCH			</p>			<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">				We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ has given the collective body of  Christian believers two specific ordinances which we must  do:			</p>						<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">				1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	BAPTISM IN WATER			</p>						<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">				This is to declare to the world that we have died with Christ and that we also have been raised with Him to walk in the newness of life.  ( Matthew 28:19; Acts 10:47,48; Romans 6:4 )			</p>						<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">					2.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD'S SUPPER			</p>						<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">					This ordinance is to (1) symbolize our sharing the divine nature of our Lord Jesus Christ ( 2 Peter 1:4 ); (2) to commemorate His death 	            ( 1 Corinthians 11:26 ); and (3) to anticipate His return                                      ( 1 Corinthians 11:26 )			</p>			<h3 class="left-20p">X.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECOND  COMING OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST </h3>			<p class="bottom-10 top-10 left-60p">				We believe in the literal, personal, glorious and pre-millennial return of the Lord Jesus Christ   ( 1 Corinthians 15:51-57; Acts 1;11; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 ).  We further believe of the following  in relation to His return:			</p>						<p class="bottom-10 left-60p">				A.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TRANSLATION OR RAPTURE			</p>						<p class="bottom-10 left-60p">				We believe that in His coming, those who have died in Christ will be resurrected to be translated together with those who are still alive to meet JESUS in the air and to be with Him. ( 1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; Titus 2:13 ) 			</p>						<p class="bottom-10 left-60p">				The rapture will include all true Christians since the beginning of time, from all  nations, cultures, denominations and sects.			</p>							<p class="bottom-10 left-60p">				B.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MILLENNEAL REIGN			</p>						<p class="bottom-10 left-60p">				We believe that after His return here, Jesus will reign with the saints on earth for one thousand years. ( Matthew 24:27-30; Revelations 1:7; 19:11-14 ). Jerusalem will be His capital of rule. At this time, the world’s population will continue to expand. Christians will be given specific positions and leadership tasks to fulfill.			</p>						<p class="bottom-10 left-60p">				C.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE FINAL JUDGMENT			</p>						<p class="bottom-10 left-60p">				There will be a final judgment in which the wicked dead  will be raised and judged according to their works. Whoever is not found written in the Book of Life will be consigned to everlasting punishment in the lake of fire.                                  ( Matthew 25:46; Mark 9:43-49; Revelations 19:20; 20:11-15; 21:8 )			</p>						<h3 class="left-20p">XI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BIBLICAL AND COMPREHENSIVE WORSHIP </h3>			<p class="bottom-10 top-10 left-60p">				We believe that God desires to be praised and worshipped always specially by those who already know Him personally in the light of the Bible. ( John 4:20-24 ) In fact, we believe that worship is the main reason for man’s creation, existence and salvation . The main components  of true worship is in truth and spirit. 			</p>			<p class="bottom-10 left-60p">				A.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WORSHIP IN TRUTH			</p>						<p class="bottom-10 left-60p">				To worship God in truth is to worship Him in the light of His word, the Holy 	Bible.			</p>						<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">				1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LIVING A RIGHTEOUS LIFE  ( SANCTIFICATION )			</p>			<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">				By living in accordance to God’s commandments and directives, one is able to really worship and glorify God. This is the life that goes against the system of the world and is characterized by goodness, holiness and liveliness.                 ( Romans 12:1,2; Matthew 5:48 )			</p>						<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">							2.						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SERVING GOD THROUGH ONE’S TALENTS AND SPIRITUAL GIFTS			</p>			<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">				We have been given various kinds of talents and skills. These are mainly meant to be used for  glorifying God and edifying others. 		            ( 1 Peter 4:9-10; 1 Corinthians 12 & 14 )			</p>										<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">				3.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUNDING IN GOOD WORKS			</p>						<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">				Christians have been saved to abound in good works. They are in fact, Christ’s workmanship. ( Ephesians 2:6-9 ) We are commanded to abound in good works and are assured that our good works will never be in vain.                        ( 1 Corinthians 15:58;  Galatians 6:9,10 )			</p>									<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">				4.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  SUPPORTING THE WORKS OF GOD THROUGH FINANCIAL AND MATERIAL GIVING			</p>						<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">				Financial giving to support God’s works and workers, if done in an attitude of gratitude, love and cheerfulness, can be an effective way of worshipping God. This comes from a clear understanding that God’s works and workers here on earth need human participation to be fully accomplished and to be adequately supported, respectively.                                                                             ( 2 Corinthians 8 & 9; Philippians 4:9, 19 )			</p>						<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">				5.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WINNING SOULS IN CHRIST			</p>						<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">				Leading other people to Christ in acts of repentance and acceptance of Him, is one of the best ways to worship and glorify God. It brings exultations in the heavens and high honors to the holiness, wisdom, power and  love of God towards men. 			(  John 1:35-51; Luke 15:7;  Acts 3:19; )			</p>						<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">				Soulwinning, therefore, is no just a Christian responsibility but a great Christian privilege as well. It’s indeed a privilege to let others come to God as repentant sinners and grateful worshippers.  				( Acts 1:8; 2 Corinthians 5:10-21; Matthew 24:14; 28:18-20; Luke 24:47 )			</p>			<p class="bottom-10 left-60p">				B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	WORSHIP IN SPIRIT			</p>						<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">				To worship God in spirit is to worship Him from the depths of our inmost being: our hearts and mind.  It is worship that is based on one’s  devotion and  love to 0God. ( Matthew 22:37 )			</p>						<h3 class="left-20p">XII. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	BIBLICAL PRAISE</h3>			<p class="bottom-10 top-10 left-60p">				We believe that praise, one of the more manifestative ways of honoring God, is so desired by Him from us that He has set forth ways how to do it. These include, among others, the following:			</p>									<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">				1.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; verbal declarations of gratitude and adoration towards God                                              				( Psalm 66:8,17; 98:4; Acts 6:4; Hebrews 13:15 )			</p>						<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">				2.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; singing unto Him ( Psalm 47:6 )			</p>			<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">				3.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; joyful noise for Him ( Psalm 66:1,2; 95:1 )			</p>			<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">				4.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; musical instruments ( Psalms 33:2; 57:8; 150 )			</p>			<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">						5.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dancing before God ( Psalm 30:11; 149:3; 150:4 )			</p>			<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">				6.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lifting up hands towards Him ( Psalm 63:4; 134:2 )			</p>			<p class="bottom-10 left-80p">				7.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clapping of hands in honor of Him ( Psalm 47:1; 98:8 )			</p>					<h3 class="left-20p">XIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	DIVINE HEALING</h3>			<p class="bottom-10 top-10 left-60p">				We believe in divine healing as part of the gospel implications. Deliverance from sickness is provided for in the atonement and is a privilege of Christians.  God’s healing manifestations include deliverance from direct demonic attacks like oppression, depression, obsession and even possession.				( Isaiah 53:4; Matthew 8:16,17; Psalm 103: 1-3 )			</p>			<p class="bottom-30 left-60p">				Divine healing may be directly given by God to its recipient in response to that person’s private prayer; or as an answer to the believing prayers of others, like the church elders, who have prayed for the sick and/or demonized. 				( James 5:14-16;  Matthew 8:1 – 9:8;  Mark 16:17,18 )			</p>		</div>	</div><br/>	<?php echo $footer; ?>
