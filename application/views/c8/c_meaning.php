					     It can be said that the C8 Campaign is a total church program that involves all aspects of the Christian life.
     It aims to facilitate the maturity and productivity of all the members of the JSOS Christian Church ( Kapamuso ) and the other partner churches and Christian individuals. It also aims to prepare them to the return of the Lord Jesus Christ and the accompanying events.
     To better understand the comprehensiveness of the said campaign, let's look at the eight meanings of "C" in it.

				</p>
				
				<!-- CHRISTIANITY -->
				
				<div class="c_desc" id="c1_desc">
					<h3 class="left-20p">CHRISTIANITY on 8</h3><br/>
					<p class="bottom-10">It refers to the things that a Christian needs to know about the information, principles and challenges the Number EIGHT (8) presents as far as the Bible is concerned.</p> 
					<p class="bottom-10">We at the JSOS Christian Church believe that every part of the Bible is sovereignly planned by God. No word, number or instances were used there without purpose. That goes with the use of the number 8.</p>
					<p class="bottom-10">Some Bible numerology experts say prominent numbers have special meanings. For instance,7 is often called the number of divine perfection. The number 2 denotes emphasis and sweetness; the number 10 points to human government and perfection while the number 12 refers to God's people.</p>
					<p class="bottom-10">The number 8's messages, while not as easily revealed as those numbers, have certainly meaningful implications as well.</p>
					<p class="bottom-10">For instance, did you know that God commanded the Jewish men to be circumcised on their eighth day? Even the Lord Jesus Christ Himself was circumcised eight days after he was born. Did you also know that the animals God meant to be sacrificed became worthy for offering only after eight days? There were also only eight survivors to the Great Deluge. These and many more uses of the number seem to convey vital implications and challenges.</p>
					<p class="bottom-10">While we don't believe in superstition and plain luck, we are convinced that a thorough study of the instances the number 8 was used in the Bible will show us many meaningful things that will add up challenges and inspiration in our Christian lives.</p>

				</div>
				
				
				<!-- CONFORMITY -->
				
				<div class="c_desc" id="c2_desc">
					<h3 class="left-20p">CONFORMITY towards 8</h3><br/>
					
					<p class="bottom-10">This refers to our members' personal recognition of the information and the challenges the messages God relays through the Biblical use of the number 8. </p>
					<p class="bottom-10">This means it is always best for Christians to acknowledge that studying on this matter is helpful in their own Christian lives.</p>
					<p class="bottom-10">For instance, realizing that the Jewish males were commanded to have their circumcision at eight days old, and that their animals were declared by God to be worthy for offering once these reached eight days old, should make Christians recognize the necessity to offer themselves to God early on in life.</p>
				</div>
				
				
				<!-- COMMITMENT -->
				
				<div class="c_desc" id="c3_desc">
					<h3 class="left-20p">COMMITMENT for 8</h3><br/>
					    
					<p class="bottom-10">This refers to the commitment to the principles and challenges the messages of the number 8 present in the Bible. </p>
					<p class="bottom-10">Not only do the Christians acknowledge the practical implications of this realization, but more importantly, commit their time and efforts in striving to fulfil the  challenges it presents. Over-all, the JSOS Christian Church members are expected to support totally C8 Campaign.</p> 
					
				</div>

				<!-- CURRICULUM -->
				
				<div class="c_desc" id="c4_desc">
					<h3 class="left-20p">CURRICULUM of 8</h3><br/>
					<p class="bottom-10">This refers to a comprehensive curriculum that comprises all essential elements of a truly maturing and reproducing Christian life. Each unit features eight topics which ideally runs for eight sessions, or two months.</p>
					<p class="bottom-10">It will serve as the main discipleship program of the church, and includes, among  others:</p>
						<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Eight Assurances in the Christian Life</p>
						<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Eight Steps to Genuine Christian Maturity</p>
						<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Eight Qualities of a Chris-like Character</p>
						<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Eight Major Christian Doctrines</p>
						<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Eight Key Steps to Serving God </p>

				</div>

				<!-- COMMUNITY -->
				
				<div class="c_desc" id="c5_desc">
					<h3 class="left-20p">COMMUNITY of 8</h3><br/>
					<p class="bottom-10">This particular thrust refers to the holding of programs and activities which will develop dynamic and intensifying fellowship among the JSOS official members through small group( kapamuso ). It includes the implementation of the eight-part Covenant of a Caring Group and the 16 "One Anothers" of the NIV New Testament ( love, greet, accept, forgive, etc. )</p>
					<p class="bottom-10">In this project, church members will be divided into small groups called Care Flocks. They will stay together for at least two months, discussing either the SHA ( Sermon Huddle for Application ) and/or the official C8 Curriculum.   </P>
					<p class="bottom-10">After about three months, they will be assigned to other Care Flocks to maximize closeness with the rest of the JSOS Family </P>

				</div>

				<!-- CIRCLE -->
				
				<div class="c_desc"  id="c6_desc">
					<h3 class="left-20p">CIRCLE of 8</h3><br/>
					<p class="bottom-10">This is called a circle because the main thrust is to let each member of the Care Flock develop in every possible way of ministering to God and others. During this period, each member take turns in being in-charge of the CF program , prayer, testimony and special number.</P>
					<p class="bottom-10">Through this, various Christian and leadership skills are also taught and practiced one by one. This includes the holding of personal devotion, intercession, Scripture memory, fasting, personal soulwinning, and particular leadership skills.</p>
					<p class="bottom-10">In effect, the resulting product of the Circle of 8 is a Christian who is willing and ready to minister in various ways.</p>


				</div>

				<!-- CHRIST-LIKENESS -->
				
				<div class="c_desc" id="c7_desc">
					<h3 class="left-20p">CHRIST-LIKENESS in 8</h3><br/>
					<p class="bottom-10">This is the highest goal of the C8 Campaign for every member of the JSOS Christian Church: to be conformed to the 'image' of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
					<p class="bottom-10">In this thrust, comprehensive Bible study and meditation on the eight major qualities of a matured Christian from St. Peter's list is undertaken.  This list is mirrored to every member in such a way that he will be personally motivated to develop a Christ-like character. He will be using the official personal planning worksheet of the JSOS to monitor his development on each quality.</p>
					<p class="bottom-10">Of course, group admonition, reminder, monitoring and practical supports will be given to each member by his Care Flock for this cause.</p>

				</div>

				<!-- CHURCH -->
				
				<div class="c_desc" id="c8_desc">
					<h3 class="left-20p">CHURCH of 8</h3><br/>
					        
					<p class="bottom-10">This may be considered the most prophetic thrust of the C8 Campaign.</p> 
					<p class="bottom-10">We want every Kapamuso to become mature and productive Christian and member of the JSOS Christian Church. Such individual maturity will eventually make a gathering of even a small group of members become a virtually small but stable church.</p>
					<p class="bottom-10">This small group of small believers will then be entrusted, in due time, to have their own communion, praying for the sick , water baptism and other church tasks.</p>
					<p class="bottom-10">To do this, there will be times when members of the JSOS Christian Church will be grouped according to their residential locations.</p>
					<p class="bottom-10">This practice will make the JSOS Christian Church relatively strong from the so-called grass roots.</p>
					<p class="bottom-10">This will be an huge advantage in case of unforeseen circumstances like calamities or severe persecution, when the actual gathering of the entire church membership is difficult or dangerous. </p>
