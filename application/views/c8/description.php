					<p class="bottom-10">The C8 Campaign is a set off extensive programs and projects that will eventually define the specific calling and identity of the JESUS: Sovereign Overcoming Shepherd Christian Church. </p> 
					<p class="bottom-10">In a nut shell, this campaign may be called a total church program involving eight major areas of ministries and purposes of Christians and a local Christian Church; and culminating in an adequate preparation of the body of the Lord Jesus Christ for the end-times, until the return of our dear Master and Savior.</p>

					<h3 class="left-20p">The "C's" and the "8's" in the C8 Campaign</h3><br/>
					<p class="bottom-10">The “C” in C8 Campaign refers to the eight words that describe the believer of the Lord Jesus Christ in relation to each other and the local church, as well as their collective tasks </p> 	
					<p class="bottom-10">The “8” in C8 Campaign, meanwhile, refers to the lessons and challenges the number eight (8) in the Bible present to the Christians, and the local church.</p>

					<h3 class="left-20p">The Three Phases of the Campaign</h3><br/>
					<p class="bottom-10">This Campaign has three major phases; each of which has eight fundamental components. The three phases covers this year, 2014, and proceeds until the return of the Lord Jesus Christ. </p> 	
					<p class="bottom-10">The <span class="highlight">First Phase </span> is perceived to be the longest. It focuses on the eight major components of what is supposed to be the main tasks and privileges of a truly maturing and well-rounded Christian church</p> 	
					<p class="bottom-10">The <span class="highlight">Second Phase</span> is actually an extension of the eight thrust/component of the First Phase, which is Community Outreach. This is about a comprehensive system of reaching out to communities, beginning with Angono where the JSOS Main is located.  It will then proceed to reach out communities where the official JSOS Christian Church members reside.</p> 	
					<p class="bottom-10">Finally, this Second Phase will focus on establishing daughter churches and/or ministry satellites as the Lord leads.</p> 	
					<p class="bottom-10">The <span class="highlight">Third Phase</span> of the C8 Campaign will occur much later. It will focus on eight major thrusts that will network with other churches and denominations in evangelizing peoples and communities, in assisting in the mobilization of Christian organizations to spread the gospel further, and in the preparation of the body of Christ for the coming escathological events.  </p>

				<div class="c_desc" id="c5_desc">
					<h3 class="left-20p">The Simple Beginning</h3><br/>
					<p class="bottom-10">The vision and mission for the C8 Campaign were initially presented through a series of sermons last September, 2013. </p>	
					<p class="bottom-10">If and when considerably implemented together by the local church, the C8 Campaign, will certainly be a mighty tool of our great God in effecting a well-rounded, and growing church, both in quality and quantity, in its local setting;</p>
