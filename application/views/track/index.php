					TRACK aims to connect with as many Christians through out the Philippines and around the world as much as possible.
				</p>
				<p class="bottom-20">	
					It traces its root from a conviction and vision personally received during the Call 2 All Philippine Congress held by the YWAM ( Youth With A Mission ) in Cebu City, Philippines, way back in March, 2012. This was participated in by representatives from key Christian organizations in the world and Christian leaders from many countries.
				</p>
				<p class="bottom-20">	
					The main purpose of this Congress was to challenge Christians the world over to contribute to the fulfillment of the Lord Jesus Christ’s Great Commission: the making of disciples from all the people-groups on Earth. In fact, every attendee of Call2All was led to commit particular tasks in this regard. The overwhelming response to the challenge was mainly caused by the realization of the nearness of Jesus Christ’s return
				</p>	
				<p class="bottom-20">	
					We honestly feel in Christians on T.R.A.C.K. that as an added contribution to these divinely inspired working together of Christians worldwide, a blog/website of this kind must go viral. Of course, we are already aware and are, in fact, thankful to God that a number of these are already operational.
				</p>
				<p class="bottom-20">	
					We just believe that putting up one more is part of our calling, and we are determined, by God’s enabling, to reach and encourage as many Christian groups as possible, beginning with those in the Philippines.
				</p>
				<p class="bottom-20">	
					To get a more complete picture of the goal of this 'section', it’s vital to know the words that make up ” t.r.a.c.k.” in its name. It actually means Technology-Redeeming Alliance for Christ’s Kingdom.
				</p>
				<p class="bottom-20">	
					So, this home page and the blogsite/website to be established later, is a manifestation of an alliance of Christians who are bent on jamming the wrong use of technology, aptly pinnacled by the worldwide web.
				</p>
				<p class="bottom-20">	
					It’s an attempt to use the internet ( and other technologies of today ), to inform. unify and edify the Christians and their organizations so that they will be more able to fulfill the Great Commission and hasten the return of the Lord Jesus Christ.
				</p>
				<p class="bottom-20">	
					It will also recognize individuals and organizations that are using effectively modern technology and connect them to the Christian world.
